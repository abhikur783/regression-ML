    "Q1. Explain the concept of R-squared in linear regression models. How is it calculated, and what does it\n",

    "Ans:R-squared is a statistical measure that is used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It represents \n",

    "R-squared is calculated by taking the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance. The explained variance is the sum \n",
